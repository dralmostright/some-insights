### db_nk_buffer_cache
###

* Controls what size of data blocks are to be fetched from datafiles to buffer cache
* the parameter is put into effect vi parameter db_nk_buffer_cache and now downtime is required.
(n=2,4,8,16,32)
* the buffer size specified in db_nk_buffer_cache is dedicated and not stealed by other components
* mendatory to set when tablespace with non-standard data block size are to be created.
* Operating system-specific block size restrictions apply.
* Should be set with proper understanding of application and data otherwise may lead to wastage of buffer

--the value for n>8 is good for OLAP and batch processing systems.
--with n>8 data transfer to memory are faster (blocks with 16k or 32k are directly fetched into memory) 
--with n>8 less probability of chained and migrated rows 
--with n>8 good for sequential access, or very large rows
